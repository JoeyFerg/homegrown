# team-bryson

Team Bryson (Joey Ferguson, Ross Otto, Joe Schuette, Jake Smarrella, and Harrison VanDerNoord) are
creating **Gardener's Exchange**, which is a platform that allows users to buy and sell locally-grown
foods within a certain radius of their location.  
  
This will be created using Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL.
